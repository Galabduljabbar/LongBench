The former head of counter terrorism at MI6, Richard Barrett, told the BBC how hard it could be to detect attacks of the type seen in Woolwich - despite the suspects having been known to MI5 for eight years. \"I assume that these people are probably coming out of a small group without, necessarily, any overseas connections or any other broader connections in the United Kingdom which could come to the attention of the security services more than they did,\" he said. \"When does a person who expresses radical views, who joins a radical group, flip over to be a violent extremist? To find the signals, the red flags as it were, I think is enormously hard.\" Former Metropolitan Police commissioner, Lord Blair, told BBC radio he hoped the committee investigating how the suspects were monitored \"would act fast\" to establish what might have gone wrong. \"I think it's important for the public to have somebody say within the limits of legality that either something was mistaken, either decisions were badly taken or they weren't, because I think it's important for the public to know security services and the police are operating properly,\" he said.

UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest.

The Kremlin said the two enjoyed a passing handshake at the summit ahead of the talks later in the day. Trump has said he wants to find ways to work with Putin, a goal made more difficult by sharp differences over Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine, and allegations Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The legislation must be passed by the Senate before it can become law. The Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups in France are opposed to the bill. Supporters say same-sex couples should have equal rights to marry and adopt children. Same-sex marriage in France came one step closer to legality Tuesday, as lawmakers in the lower house of parliament approved a controversial bill that would extend the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples. The measure was voted through in the National Assembly by 329 in favor to 229 against, with 10 deputies abstaining. The bill must still go before the senate before it becomes law. If passed, it would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. France is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue of same-sex marriage. UK lawmakers took a big step last week toward legalizing same-sex marriage when they approved the second reading of a bill in the House of Commons. But while a significant number of MPs back the legislation, which is supported by Prime Minister David Cameron, the move has prompted widespread rebellion within Cameron's Conservative Party. The bill must go through several more stages before it can become law. Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples in France was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. The National Assembly, which is dominated by Hollande's Socialist Party, was expected to pass the bill Tuesday, having approved the most important article of the law with a wide majority earlier this month. The left also controls the Senate. But the plan faces stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives, with huge numbers turning out for protest marches in Paris in recent weeks. Another big rally against the law is planned for next month. Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, voiced his opposition at a meeting of French bishops in Lourdes last year. Opening up marriage to same-sex couples \"would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone,\" he said. At the same time, failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a \"deceit\" that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children, he said. Other religious groups, including Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, have also expressed their concern over the draft bill, and many lawmakers and hundreds of mayors are against the legislation. The legislation has won wide backing from gay rights advocates, however. The French gay, lesbian and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT has said the law, if passed, \"would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights.\" Lawmakers have a \"unique opportunity\" to put an end to outdated discrimination, the group said in a statement. \"The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families, without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity,\" it said. A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS (pacte civil de solidarite), the civil union agreement can be entered into by gay or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage. Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Spain, South Africa and Norway are among nearly a dozen countries that allow same-sex marriages. Polls show the U.S. public has gradually become more accepting of the idea, with more Americans in favor in 2013 than opposed, according to Pew. Nonetheless, 30 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. The issue has also divided Australia, where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed \"support marriage equality.\" According to a report released in May 2011 by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, same-sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries, and in five of those countries, the death penalty can be applied to those who violate the laws.

Nobody has epitomised these values more at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 than runners Abbey D’Agostino (USA) and Nikki Hamblin (NZL) and, beyond the Games, the Norwegian men’s handball team. The International Fair Play Committee (CIFP), with the support of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), presented them with Fair Play awards today at the Olympic Club in the Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro for two separate acts of selflessness and exemplary sportsmanship. The D’Agostino and Hamblin story is one of humanity and sacrifice which has already captured the hearts of people across the globe. New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin tripped and fell to the ground during the 5,000m race, accidentally bringing American D’Agostino down behind her with around 2,000m to go. The 24-year-old D’Agostino was quick to get up again, yet instead of carrying on with her race she stopped to help the stricken Hamblin to her feet, encouraging her to join her in attempting to finish the race. However, during her tumble, D’Agostino suffered an ankle injury, slowing the runner down, but Hamblin sportingly hung back to in return offer her encouragements. The two women went on to complete the race together. Speaking of this recognition after the ceremony, 28-year-old Nikki Hamblin said: “I think it’s very special for both Abbey and myself. I don’t think either of us woke up and thought that that was going to be our day, or our race, or our Olympic Games. Both of us are strong competitors and we wanted to go out there and do our best on the track.” She added: “I was on the ground for too long to get back up and catch on to the pack. So then it becomes about finishing the race, and finishing the race well. I am so grateful to Abbey for picking me up, and I think many people would have returned the favour. […] Once you are on the track, there is a mutual understanding of what it takes to get there.” The Norwegian men’s handball team was also honoured for its gracious attitude during a European championship match against Germany earlier this year, which saw them lose out on their Olympic dream. The match was tied when at the last minute the German team scored a goal. It was discovered that when the goal had been scored an extra player had come onto the field. Although the Norwegian team had every right to file a protest, after much deliberation, they finally opted not to contest the results as they felt that the additional player on the field, though illegal, did not partake in the activities that helped the German team score the final goal. Germany went on to qualify for the Olympics, while the Norwegians did not. “This is an honour for the Norwegian Handball Federation and for the players,” commented the President of the Norwegian Handball Federation Kaare Geir Lio. “It is also recognition for international handball, of how we want to play, and of how we want to be. We have fair play as a value and keyword in Norwegian handball in addition to respect, amongst others. And those two together are very important for us. This award is very energising and inspiring for us.” The trophies were presented by IOC Vice-President and Executive Board Member Nawal El Moutawakel and master of ceremonies CIFP Secretary General Sunil Sabharwal. Nawal El Moutawakel said: “The Olympic Games Rio 2016 have reminded all of us of the power and magic of sport. In the past weeks, the athletes have amazed us with their outstanding achievements and performances. We have seen new world records, we have seen high-level performances, we have seen personal bests and we have also seen great emotions. We have also been inspired by great moments of sportsmanship. Athletes are inspirational role models, and it is these moments of fair play that we have come together to celebrate today.” ", "answers": ["One of the most touching moments of the Rio Olympics has been rewarded with this year's Fair Play Awards.

Hamblin then stayed with her fellow runner when she realized D'Agostino had injured her leg in the fall. \"Winning this award is overwhelming,\" says Hamblin, per the Sydney Morning Herald. \"I am proud [at] what we did and truly believe that you can be both a competitor and kind and responsive at the same time,\" she says. \"Everyone comes here to compete, but there are a lot of people who don't achieve that, and the journey is really important, too.\" The IOC decided to allow both women to compete in the final, though D'Agostino was too injured to take part, the Guardian reports."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1345}

The shrine, which draws a growing stream of visitors, was visited by Mary in 1859 by a Belgian immigrant named Adele Brise, who was instructed to teach Catholic beliefs to children. After a two-year investigation by theologians, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay declared that Ms. Brise did indeed have encounters of a supernatural character that are worthy of belief. The shrine has been a source of hope and healing for people, including victims of errant priests, and the church's scandals did not influence the decision.

Ricken of Green Bay to declare “with moral certainty” that Brise had encounters “of a supernatural character” that are “worthy of belief.” The Vatican, wary of fraud, gives local bishops the primary responsibility of evaluating apparitions, in part by using guidelines set by the Vatican in 1978.

But if you know anything about Alien movies, you'll know there's only terror in store. Here's what critics are saying about the latest installment of the franchise, with director Ridley Scott of 1979's Alien returning: The filmmakers have finally managed to \"dig the series out of its hole,\" Todd McCarthy puts it at the Hollywood Reporter. He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender—who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots—also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2356}

Booker defeated three other candidates: U.S. Reps. Rush Holt and Frank Pallone, and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver. Booker will now face Steve Lonegan, the Republican primary winner, in the Oct. 16 special election to succeed the late Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.). Booker is famous in the political world for his life story and his social media fanaticism: He has 1.4 million followers on Twitter, which he uses to field complaints about local issues such as sinkholes and to dispense inspirational quotes. He grew up in suburban Harrington Park, the son of some of the first black IBM executives, played football at Stanford, won a Rhodes scholarship, received a law degree from Yale, then moved into one of the toughest parts of Newark in an effort to revive the state's largest city. He is in his second term as mayor. In the city, reviews are mixed, but his narrative has helped make him well-known elsewhere. And he's leveraged that power to help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in grant money for the city, including a $100 million pledge from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He's also given 90 paid speeches across the country since 2008, collecting $1.3 million, nearly half of which he has donated to charity. Lonegan, who stepped down from his job as state director of the anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity, focused his primary campaign on blasting Booker. He held a news conference to ridicule Booker's broad anti-childhood poverty plan and another at the scene of a homicide in Newark to question whether Booker has done much to reduce crime. He's also been to the New York headquarters of Waywire, a technology startup Booker co-founded, to criticize his role in it. For Booker, the new opponent means needing to gird himself for attacks from the right after spending an abbreviated primary campaign being criticized from the left by opponents. In debates, Booker found himself defending working with Christie, explaining that he disagrees with the governor \"90 percent of the time\" and promoting his conciliatory image. He also reaffirmed his support for using taxpayer money to send children to private schools, one of the few policy prescriptions on which he and Lonegan agree. Lonegan is a familiar voice in New Jersey politics, blunt and conservative. He ran in and lost gubernatorial primaries in 2005 and 2009. He was a leader of successful opposition to ballot measures that would have raised a state sales tax and funded stem-cell research. Like Booker, he grew up in suburban Bergen County, in Ridgefield Park, and played college football, at William Paterson. Both candidates also became better known through documentaries released in 2005. \"Anytown, U.S.A.\" looked at Lonegan's fiery re-election campaign in Bogota, and \"Street Fight\" chronicled Booker's first, and losing, run for mayor of Newark.

{"pred": " Here is a one-page summary of all the news: A judge who asked a sexual assault complainant why she couldn't keep her \"knees together\" confirmed he will resign after the Canadian Judicial Council recommended his removal. Justice Robin Camp issued a statement Thursday in which he said he will resign from the Federal Court of Canada effective Friday. \"I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments,\" Camp’s statement went on. \"I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" The Canadian Judicial Council’s report called Camp’s conduct “so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that the judge was rendered incapable of executing the judicial office.\" Justice Camp’s lawyer Frank Addario had argued that removal was not necessary to preserve public confidence in this case. Four of the council's 23 members did not support removal. Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was in the process of moving forward on the council’s recommendation in Parliament Thursday when she learned of Camp’s resignation. Wilson-Raybould later told reporters that the extremely rare removal would have been needed “to ensure the integrity and public confidence in the justice system and the judiciary.” “Sexual assault and gender-based violence is in no form acceptable and we will continue to stand up for victims of sexual assault and gender-based violence,” Wilson-Raybould added. Norman Sabourin, Executive Director and Senior General Council at the Canadian Judicial Council, told CTV News Channel removals are recommended when the “public has lost confidence in a judge’s ability to discharge the duties of office.” “The report of the council emphasizes that all judges have to know the law but also have to possess empathy, have to understand that people who come before them are often vulnerable people and they have to treat them with a degree of civility and deference,” Sabourin said. Camp, who was appointed to the federal court in 2015, faced judicial review after it was revealed that he had stated in a 2014 Alberta provincial court decision that \"pain and sex sometimes go together” and asked the complainant why she didn’t just “keep her knees together.” He also said, \"Young wom[e]n want to have sex, particularly if they're drunk.\" Alexander Wagar was acquitted by Camp. Alberta’s Appeal Court ordered a new trial and last month Wagar was again acquitted. The complainant, who was 19 at the time of the first trial, told the disciplinary hearing last year that Camp's comments had made her hate herself. She said she had contemplated suicide as a result of her experience. After Thursday’s decision, the complainant said \"I was feeling so unhopeful and pretty down and not very hopeful about the justice system but it has kind of turned around by this.” Alice Woolley, the University of Calgary law professor who complained about Camp’s conduct, said she was pleased with the decision. “Actors within the legal system can make really terrible decisions and terrible mistakes and in his case engage in real misconduct,” she said. “But the legal system orients towards progress,” she added. Kathleen Mahoney, who is also a law professor at the University of Calgary, told CTV News Channel that she believes the removal is a “watershed moment” in how courts treat sexual assault. “I think this is a very strong statement from the judges of Canada that the time has come that gender bias in these kinds of decisions will no longer be tolerated,” she said. Mahoney added that she believes the case highlights the need for mandatory judicial training focusing on gendered issues such sexual assault, domestic violence and sexual harassment. The Conservatives have introduced legislation that would require better training for judges in handling sexual assault cases. The justice minister agreed Thursday that judges need to be properly trained. Camp’s decision is not the only recent case to raise questions about how judges handle sexual assault. In Halifax earlier this month, Justice Gregory Lenehan acquitted a taxi driver accused of sexually assaulting a passenger so intoxicated that she passed out.

{"pred": " Here is a one-page summary of all the news: A Jewish nurse who treated Robert Bowers moments after the Squirrel Hill synagogue shooting said he saw “confusion” but not “evil” when he looked into his eyes. Ari Mahler, one of two Jewish medical professionals to treat Bowers at Allegheny General Hospital on Oct. 27, said in a lengthy Facebook post over the weekend that Bowers “thanked me for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.” Mahler, a registered nurse at Allegheny General since May, said he did not reveal his Jewish identity to Bowers. “I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish. Why thank a Jewish nurse,” Mahler wrote, “when 15 minutes beforehand, you’d shoot me in the head with no remorse? … This was the same Robert Bowers that just (allegedly) committed mass homicide. The Robert Bowers who instilled panic in my heart worrying (that) my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.” Even as Bowers was saying, “I want to kill all the Jews,” he was being treated by two Jews — a trauma nurse and an attending emergency room doctor. Hospital President Dr. Jeff Cohen, who also is Jewish, declined to identify them in an earlier interview with the Tribune-Review, but Mahler said he went public on Facebook to tell his own story. “I just know I feel alone right now,” he said, “and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.” Mahler did not go into detail about his interactions with Bowers, citing medical privacy laws, but described his own experiences with anti-Semitism and his lack of surprise at the attack on Tree of Life Congregation, where 11 people were killed and six injured on Oct. 27. “The fact that this shooting took place doesn’t shock me. To be honest, it’s only a matter of time before the next one happens,” he said. “History refutes hope that things will change. My heart yearns for change, but today’s climate doesn’t foster nurturing, tolerance, or civility.” Mahler grew up the son of Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, who retired as rabbi of Temple Emanuel of South Hills, a Reform synagogue, in June. He said he experienced anti-Semitism from other school children but more from ignorance than from hate. “I found drawings on my desks of my family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on my locker, and notes shoved inside of it saying, ‘Die Jew. Love, Hitler.’ It was a different time back then, where bullying was not monitored like it is now,” he said. Mahler worked as a loan officer and a financial consultant before taking a job as a nurse at Magee-Womens Hospital in 2014, according to his LinkedIn.com profile. “As an adult, deflecting my religion by saying ‘I’m not that religious,’ makes it easier for people to accept I’m Jewish — especially when I tell them my father is a rabbi. ‘I’m not that religious,’ is like saying, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not that Jewish, therefore, I’m not so different than you,’ and like clockwork, people don’t look at me as awkwardly as they did a few seconds beforehand,” he said. Mahler said he did his best to treat Bowers with “compassion and empathy. … I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong. Besides, if he finds out I’m Jewish, does it really matter? The better question is, what does it mean to you?” As for Bowers, Mahler said, “To be honest, I didn’t see evil when I looked into Robert Bowers’ eyes. All I saw was a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion. Robert Bowers probably had no friends, was easily influenced by propaganda, and wanted attention on a sociopathic level. He’s the kind of person that is easily manipulated by people with a microphone, a platform, and use of fear for motivation.” Mahler ended his Facebook post on the importance of “love in the face of evil. … I could (not) care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish to instill in you. If my actions mean anything, love means everything.” Dr. Jeff Cohen walked into the trauma unit at Allegheny General Hospital, and his eyes locked with synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers. Cohen, president of the Pittsburgh hospital and a longtime member of the Tree of Life Congregation, wanted to ask Bowers how he was feeling. “He’s a very lost guy,” Cohen told the Tribune-Review. “It’s just my impression. It’s not based on fact. I mean, he’s coming off the ambulance yelling ‘kill all the Jews’ and those are the people treating him. That is the height of stupidity.” Two of the lead people who immediately treated Bowers at Allegheny General were Jewish, Cohen said. They include the attending emergency room doctor and a registered nurse whose own father is a rabbi, he said. Cohen declined to name them but praised them for honoring their profession by putting their emotions aside. “It’s hard. You have this internal debate with yourself. Am I going to do what is right? And you do. You do what you think is right,” Cohen said. “The mission here is taking care of people. They didn’t ask anything about him. He was a patient.” Not long after treating Bowers, the young nurse broke down in tears. Cohen met with him for about 20 minutes and thanked him for doing his job. “He was pretty broken,” Cohen said. “I told him how proud I was. He went home and hugged his parents.” Cohen, 63, lives about 50 yards from the Tree of Life Congregation where the mass shooting occurred. He was home on Saturday morning when he heard a loud noise outside. Within minutes, his daughter yelled to him to come downstairs and they watched as police and SWAT teams descended on their street. He described the congregation as a safe place where people gather daily to pray and socialize. His own mother-in-law attends services nearly every day and knew nine of the 11 people who were killed. Cohen knew them, too, pausing to mention Cecil and David Rosenthal, two brothers killed in the massacre. “The Rosenthal brothers were both handicapped. They were very comfortable there. This is the Jewish version of ‘Cheers.’ Everybody knew their names. This was their home,” Cohen said. Cohen, who has been president of Allegheny General Hospital for two years, said that on Sunday night he became more and more curious about meeting Bowers. The suspect was being treated for gunshot wounds and had been placed in isolation to allow police to guard him while he received treatment. “I just wanted to see him with my own eyes,” he said. “He had a mother once, or maybe still does. He was loved by a family. How do you get from here to there? I wanted to have my own impression.” His conclusion: “He’s not the face of the devil. He’s just a guy who committed a very heinous act.” After last week’s deadly shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, the suspected shooter, Robert Bowers, was rushed to Allegheny General Hospital. Bowers had been wounded during a shoot-out with police. Two of the men who treated him at Allegheny General were themselves Jewish. The president of the hospital, Dr. Jeff Cohen, was a member of the Tree of Life synagogue. Cohen told the media last week that two of the people who treated Bowers were Jewish: the ER doctor, and a registered nurse. Cohen described Bowers as “lost” and said that the registered nurse, a young man, broke down in tears after treating him. Now the nurse has come forward with an emotional Facebook post about his experience treating Bowers. His name is Ari Mahler. Here’s what you need to know: 1. Mahler Says Bowers Yelled ‘Death to All Jews’ as He Was Wheeled Into the Emergency Room Mahler wrote that Robert Bowers didn’t seem evil — instead, Mahler said, the alleged shooter seemed confused and lost. Mahler speculated that Bowers was a lonely, easily-led man who had been influenced by others. The nurse wrote, “I didn’t see evil when I looked into Robert Bowers’ eyes. All I saw was a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion. Robert Bowers probably had no friends, was easily influenced by propaganda, and wanted attention on a sociopathic level. He’s the kind of person that is easily manipulated by people with a microphone, a platform, and use fear for motivation.” Mahler said that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish. He said he didn’t want to go into detail about his interactions with Bowers, but he did say that the suspect thanked him for his kindness and for saving his life. Mahler wrote that he treated Bowers just the same way as he treats all of his patients. But he also wrote that, as Bowers was being wheeled into the emergency room, he yelled, “Death to all Jews!” Jeff Cohen, the president of Allegheny General Hospital, said that after Bowers’ treatment Mahler came to him in tears, overwhelmed by what had just taken place. 2. Mahler’s Father Is a Retired Rabbi Mahler’s father is Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, who served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, a reform synagogue in South Hills, from 1980 until 2018. Rabbi Mahler retired in June of 2018. The rabbi was known for his use of music; he played guitar and sang during Sabbath services, and he led the synagogue’s band. Several of his children (not Ari) also participated in the band. Rabbi Mahler was also a member of the South Hills Interfaith Ministries and the National Conference of Christian and Jews. Rabbi Mahler and his wife Alice have four children: Ari, Shoshana, Moshe, and Shira. 3. Mahler Says He Often Experienced Anti-Semitism Growing Up Ari Mahler wrote that he was not shocked by the Pittsburgh shooting; the Pittsburgh native says that anti-Semitism is nothing new for him. As a boy, he says, he often experienced bullying because he was Jewish. He described finding swastikas scrawled on his locker at school, or finding pictures of his family being sent to the gas chamber. And, Mahler writes, he never managed to confront the bullying head-on: “I experienced anti-Semitism a lot as a kid. It’s hard for me to say if it was always a product of genuine hatred, or if kids with their own problems found a reason to single me out from others. Sure, there were a few Jewish kids at my school, but no one else had a father who was a Rabbi. I found drawings on desks of my family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on my locker, and notes shoved inside of it saying, “Die Jew. Love, Hitler.” It was a different time back then, where bullying was not monitored like it is now. I was weak, too. Rather than tell anyone, I hid behind fear. Telling on the people who did this would only lead to consequences far worse.” Mahler also says that he developed defense mechanisms to shield himself from anti-Semites. He got into the habit of telling people that he isn’t very religious. Mahler wrote that even people who view Judaism positively often seem to feel uncomfortable when they meet Jewish people. And so, he says, he’s learned over the years how to ease awkward moments by deflecting attention from his Jewishness. 4. Mahler Worked as a Financial Consultant Before Going to Work as a Nurse Ari Mahler was an honors student at the University of Maryland, graduating in 1999 with a BA in English. Mahler went on to work as a loan officer for American Equity, and then as a financial consultant for PNC. Then, in 2013, Mahler enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Nursing, again earning honors and graduating the next year as a registered nurse. Mahler found work as a registered nurse at Magee Women’s Hospital; he switched to working at Allegheny General in March of 2018. 5. Mahler Concluded His Facebook Post With a Plea for Love in the Face of Evil Mahler wrote movingly about his decision to treat Bowers with “compassion” and “empathy.” He wrote that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish, and just treated him with the same care that he would use on any patient. He wrote, “I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.” Mahler wrapped up his Facebook post with a plea. He wrote, “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. The meaning of life is to give meaning to life, and love is the ultimate force that connects all living beings. I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish to instill in you.

{"pred": " Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern Oregon that could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western North America. The tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate not normally found in eastern Oregon, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. If the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago. Near the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley, archaeologists recently discovered evidence suggesting one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States. Their discoveries have included a number of stone projectile points and tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel (Camelops sp.) that became extinct approximately 13,000 years ago. But what has the archaeological community most excited is a small stone tool found below a layer of volcanic ash. Near the bottom of a 12-foot deposit, archaeologists discovered a layer of ash that was identified as volcanic ash from a Mt. St. Helens eruption about 15,800 years ago. Beneath the layer of volcanic ash, archaeologists discovered a small orange agate tool believed to have been used for scraping animal hides, butchering, and possibly carving wood. A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo. “The discovery of this tool below a layer of undisturbed ash that dates to 15,800 years old means that this tool is likely more than 15,800 years old, which would suggest the oldest human occupation west of the Rockies,” said Scott Thomas, BLM Burns District archaeologist. Presently, Oregon’s Paisley Cave, also managed by the BLM, is considered home to the earliest known residents of North America based on human physical evidence. In 2008, a team of archaeologists, led by Dr. Dennis Jenkins with the University of Oregon's Museum of Natural and Cultural History, discovered coprolites - dried feces - containing human DNA dated over 14,000 years old. Dr. Patrick O’Grady, with the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, has been directing the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter excavations since they began. “When we had the volcanic ash identified, we were stunned, because that would make this stone tool one of the oldest artifacts in North America. Given those circumstances and the laws of stratigraphy, this object should be older than the ash,” said O’Grady. “While we need more evidence before we can make an irrefutable claim, we plan to expand our excavation this summer and hopefully provide further evidence of artifacts found consistently underneath that layer of volcanic ash. That’s the next step,” he added. The University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the BLM and volunteers from the Oregon Archaeological Society, will begin its fifth season this summer, offering students, researchers and volunteers invaluable field experience. Stan McDonald, BLM Oregon/Washington lead archaeologist, explained the potential this discovery has for the archaeological community. “For years, many in the archaeological field assumed that the first humans in the western hemisphere were the Clovis people – dating to around 13,000 years ago,\" McDonald said. “While a handful of archaeological sites older than Clovis cultures have been discovered in the past few decades, there is still considerable scrutiny of any finding that appears older.” “With the recent findings at Rimrock Draw Shelter, we want to assemble indisputable evidence, because these claims will be scrutinized by researchers,\" he said. “That said, the early discoveries are tantalizing.” ", "answers": ["A small stone tool unearthed in eastern Oregon appears to be so ancient that the history of humans in the area may have to be rewritten, archaeologists say.

University of Washington professor of archaeology Donald K. Grayson, however, predicts there will be a lot of skepticism about the find. \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he tells the AP. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" (Experts believe they have found evidence of a long-lost civilization in the Honduran rainforest.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1460}

{"pred": " Here is a one-page summary of all the news: The Pacific coast of North America supports one of the most vibrant and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth, largely because of the presence of thick schools of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that depend on sardines as a major food source. In addition, because sardines have been a staple of commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast, their decline raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck’s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. Populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. That’s because forage fish are highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient- rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. \"Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,\" Hanson said. \"Not very well.\" To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006. Spawning has taken a dive too. In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright. \"We shouldn't be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,\" said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. The Pacific sardine is the ocean's quintessential boom-bust fish. It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools. It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California's sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world's top fishing ports. And then it collapsed. By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years. The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday. Since the 1940s scientists have debated how much of the collapse was caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. Now, researchers are posing the same question. \"It's a terribly difficult scientific problem,\" said Russ Vetter, director of the Fisheries Resources Division at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile fluctuate in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle but have been more heavily exploited, Vetter said. West Coast sardines are considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, a practice that could explain why their latest rebound lasted as long as it did. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. In recent years scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines' value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species such as herring and market squid that form the core of the ocean food web, funneling energy upward by eating tiny plankton and being preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales. Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. Melin's research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated. ", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal.

{"pred": " On Tuesday, President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, sparking shock and surprise throughout Washington. The firing ended the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. However, Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign. The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe. In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal, there would be no backlash. What was not thought through, apparently, was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe. In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was reopening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency. Trump referred to Democrats' criticism of Comey Wednesday morning, tweeting, \"The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\" Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation. Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone was among those who recommended to the President that he fire Comey, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Stone, who also is being scrutinized by the FBI as part of its Russia investigation, spoke to Trump after Comey appeared at a hearing last week on Capitol Hill, according to the source. Trump immediately disputed that Stone was involved: \"The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision.\" Stone said he was not the source behind the reporting but added that he supported the firing of Comey \"100%.\" A White House spokesperson reached out to CNN to reiterate the President's tweet that he has not spoken to Stone in a \"long time,\" adding, \"The President has not spoken to Roger Stone in many months and any reports suggesting otherwise are categorically untrue.\" The letters In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was \"hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,\" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is \"not able to effectively lead the bureau.\" \"It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,\" Trump told Comey in the letter. \"I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails. But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public. At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning. Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to \"usurp the attorney general's authority\" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution. \"Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,\" Rosenstein argued in his memo. \"We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),\" Rosenstein said. \"The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.\" Congressional reaction But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake. \"Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?\" Schumer asked. And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a \"loss for the bureau and the nation. \"I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,\" Burr said. As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed. \"I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general, is competent to lead that effort,\" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership. \"I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general, is competent to lead that effort,\" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership. But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would \"raise questions.\" Sen. John McCain added: \"While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.\" The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations. 'Absurd' CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was \"absurd.\" Toobin branded the move a \"grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.\" \"This is not something that is within the American political tradition,\" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. \"This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,\" said Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director. The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25. A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

MUST WATCH Toobin: Trump admin going to put a stooge in 01:26 Team Clinton reaction Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation. \"I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called a \"charade\" only 24 hours ago,\" said Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook. \"It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,\" he said. One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition, gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Sciutto. \"I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,\" the person said. Senior Justice Department and FBI officials said they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they were shocked by the development. Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President. Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin \"forwarded hundreds and thousands\" of emails to her husband's laptop. The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the \"hundreds and thousands of emails\" that Comey said were 'forwarded\" from Abedin to her husband's email \"included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.\" The White House said it would immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions. Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013. In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world. In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought the FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did. But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight. Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being \"extremely careless\" with sensitive information. Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the \"political\" decision. Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges. After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part. Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\" After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.

{"pred": " Here is a one-page summary of all the news: News: Passage 1: NASA's Curiosity rover has delivered some cool findings from its trips across the red planet. While the six papers released by the journal Science report on different aspects of Mars and do it from different scientific perspectives, together they present the beginnings of a new understanding of the red planet, especially in its early epochs, three to four billion years ago. Early Mars, it has become increasingly apparent, was in many important ways similar to Earth. As described in the six Science papers, that hidden but slowly materializing landscape looks something like this: 1. Early Mars was habitable, perhaps for a long time. After concluding that rivers and streams once flowed into Gale Crater, the Curiosity team has now reported that a lake existed there as well. That surface water, as well as groundwater that likely went down hundreds of meters, possessed all that was needed to support microbial life. The period when Gale Crater was warmer, wetter, and habitable was broadly between 3.5 and 4 billion or more years ago. That period is when life on Earth is understood to have arisen. Was Mars once home to primitive extraterrestrial life? Curiosity can't and won't make that determination, but its discoveries have made the possibility of Martian life significantly more plausible. 2. Water once flowed on many parts of Mars. And that water was there at times and in forms that scientists didn't believe to be possible not long ago. One of the major achievements of Curiosity so far has been to \"ground-truth\" observations made in recent years by the satellites orbiting the planet. Those instruments found strong hints that Mars had a watery past, and at Gale Crater they were found to be on target. As a result, the mission has given greater credibility to the view that thousands of additional fossil formations of what appear to be ancient streams, channels, deltas, and lakes likely are just what they appeared to be. 3. \"Follow the carbon\" has been vindicated. The search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds—one of the major goals of the Curiosity mission—has been and will continue to be complicated and trying. While as many as six different organic compounds have been identified so far by the miniature chemistry lab called Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), their origin remain unclear. There are at least two sources of the confounding results: The presence on Mars of a chlorine-based compound that, when heated in the SAM oven with any organic material, largely destroys the compounds. And the leak into the SAM ovens of an organic solvent brought to Mars as part of a wet chemistry experiment. The search for Martian organics is nonetheless making progress. With each collection of Martian sand or rock, the number of organics found and their concentration has increased—suggesting that different samples of Martian material are leading to different results. If the organics were all contaminants from Earth, those concentrations would likely be more steady. 4. Mars gets pounded by radiation. Galactic cosmic rays and solar eruptions bombard Mars, and their high-energy particles break the bonds that allow organisms to survive. The Radiation Assessment Detector on Curiosity has made the first measurements ever of radiation on the surface of Mars, and the results are sobering. In another Science paper, RAD principal investigator Donald Hassler reports that the radiation would almost certainly be fatal within a few million years to any microbial life on the surface or less than several meters deep. Notwithstanding the high levels of radiation, Hassler reported that life could theoretically still survive on Mars today under special circumstances. If a bacteria similar to D. radiodurans appeared when early Mars was wetter, warmer, and had a more protective atmosphere, he wrote, it could have survived over the epochs through long periods of dormancy. 5. Mars radiation also damages normal chemistry. Many on the Curiosity team point to radiation damage of all carbon chemistry on Mars as a major reason why it has been so difficult to identify organics on the surface. That effort, however, may have gotten a significant boost from one of the most unexpected developments to come out of the mission so far—a method to date how long surfaces have been exposed to the sky on Mars. Using measurements of radioactive decay also employed on Earth, Kenneth Farley of the California Institute of Technology reports that the surface of Yellowknife Bay has been exposed for some 80 million years. The discovery points to a method for finding places for the rover to drill where there has been less chemistry-damaging radiation exposure. Essentially, Farley said, the team has to look for cliffs or overhangs being undercut by the surface wind—as happened in Yellowknife Bay—and where radiation would be blocked by the rocks above. \"If we find that kind of formation,\" he said, \"drill there.\" 6. Detours sometimes turn out to be interesting. The Curiosity rover was scheduled to head for the scientifically alluring Mount Sharp in the center of Gale Crater soon after landing. More than 480 days into the mission, the rover is still months away from its prime destination. The detour to Yellowknife Bay is the main reason why, and it has turned out to be a gold mine of data. But now the rover is on what is called the \"rapid transit route\" to three-mile-high Mount Sharp, driving most of the time and passing many potentially interesting sites. Passage 2: NASA's Curiosity rover has found evidence of an ancient Martian lake that could have supported life as we know it for long stretches — perhaps millions of years. This long and skinny freshwater lake likely existed about 3.7 billion years ago, researchers said, suggesting that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought. \"Quite honestly, it just looks very Earth-like,\" said Curiosity lead scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"You've got an alluvial fan, which is being fed by streams that originate in mountains, that accumulates a body of water,\" Grotzinger told SPACE.com. \"That probably was not unlike what happened during the last glacial maximum in the Western U.S.\" The lake once covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, which the 1-ton Curiosity rover has been exploring since touching down on the Red Planet in August 2012. Yes - The Red Planet is teeming with tiny microbes, we just haven't found them yet. Yes - An advanced civilization lives below the surface, where we can't detect them. No - Life never existed on Mars. No - Mars once had life, but those organisms are long dead. No - Mars once had life, but those organisms are long dead. The main task of Curiosity's $2.5 billion mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover team achieved that goal months ago, announcing in March that a spot near Curiosity's landing site called Yellowknife Bay was indeed habitable billions of years ago. The new results, which are reported today (Dec. 9) in six separate papers in the journal Science, confirm and extend Curiosity's landmark discovery, painting a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago. This picture emerged from Curiosity's analysis of fine-grained sedimentary rocks called mudstones, which generally form in calm, still water. The rover obtained powdered samples of these rocks by drilling into Yellowknife Bay outcrops. The mudstones contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of an ancient freshwater lake, researchers said. Curiosity also spotted some of the key chemical ingredients for life in the samples, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon. The lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. Here on Earth, chemolithoautotrophs are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. \"It is exciting to think that billions of years ago, ancient microbial life may have existed in the lake's calm waters, converting a rich array of elements into energy,\" Sanjeev Gupta of Imperial College London, co-author of one of the new papers, said in a statement. The shallow ancient lake may have been about 30 miles long by 3 miles wide (50 by 5 kilometers), Grotzinger said. Based on the thickness of the sedimentary deposits, the research team estimates that the lake existed for at least tens of thousands of years — and perhaps much longer, albeit on a possibly on-and-off basis. Taking into account the broader geological context, \"you could wind up with an assemblage of rocks that represent streams, lakes and ancient groundwater systems — so for times when the lake might have been dry, the groundwater's still there. This could have gone on for millions or tens of millions of years,\" Grotzinger said. The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, he added, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis. But such conditions wouldn't be much of a deterrent to hardy microbes. \"These are entirely viable habitable environments for chemolithoautotrophs,\" Grotzinger said. Researchers still don't know if the Gale Crater lake hosted organisms of any kind; Curiosity was not designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars. But if chemolithoautotrophs did indeed dominate the lake, it would put an alien twist on a superficially familiar environment. \"You can imagine that, if life evolved on Mars and never got beyond the point of chemolithoautotrophy, then in the absence of competition from other types of microbes, these systems might have been dominated by that type of metabolic pathway,\" Grotzinger said. \"And that's an un-Earth-like situation.\" ", "answers": ["The Curiosity rover has discovered evidence of an ancient freshwater lake on Mars that was brimming with the key chemicals necessary to support microbial life, and its findings suggest that it could have held that life more recently than we thought—and possibly for millions of years before that. \"Quite honestly it just looks very Earth-like,\" the Curiosity's lead scientist said, according to Space.com. The lake, located in the Gale Crater, would have been about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide.

A total of 145 plants, 28 reptiles, 25 fish, 7 amphibians, 2 mammals, and 1 bird were all discovered within the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia that spans Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and the south-western Chinese province of Yunnan. At the same time, the Mekong’s wild places and wildlife are under extreme pressure from rapid, unsustainable development and climate change. WWF warns the Greater Mekong’s valuable natural assets and species will continue to disappear without accelerated efforts to green the region’s economies. The extinction of the Javan rhino in Vietnam, recently confirmed by WWF, is a tragic indicator of the decline of biodiversity in the region. “This report is an affirmation of what we know—that the Greater Mekong offers unparalleled diversity in nature—and what must be done,” said Rebecca Ng of WWF’s Greater Mekong Program. “The rich natural treasures of the region could be lost if regional governments don’t recognize that protecting biodiversity is an investment to ensure long-term sustainability, especially in the face of global environmental change.” The six leaders from the Greater Mekong Sub-region are meeting in Myanmar from December 19-20.

The Clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) off Mexico's Pacific coast. The original, and until recently the only, spotting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in a 1936 visit to Clarion, one of the four Revillagigedo Islands. He returned with one snake preserved in a glass jar. Subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and no further sightings were reported over the years from the island, which is inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines. The existing dead sample was assumed to be a labelling error and the snake was largely struck from taxonomic registries. But Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find it. Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands, noted the islands change a lot from season to season, so they timed the expedition last May to replicate Beebe's steps as they looked for the snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations and is largely active at night. And they used Beebe's original field notes as a guide. One of his graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot one of the snakes for the first time since 1936. The researchers performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and see where it had come from. The tests showed it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) away. Martinez Gomez said the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. The National Museum of Natural History said Mulcahy \"uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" Patricia Escalante, a biologist who curates bird collections at Mexico's National Autonomous University and who was not involved in the snake project, said the re-discovery of the Clarion nightsnake was \"very interesting\" and significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems. One inhabitant of the Revillagigedo Islands, the Socorro dove, went extinct in its natural habitat sometime in the 1970s.

The expedition found 11 of the snakes, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Island snake is a unique species, reports the BBC. The snake is related to snakes found on part of the Mexican coast more than 500 miles away, and researchers believe its ancestors may have arrived on a tree trunk washed out to sea long ago. Beebe returned from a visit to the island, located 400-plus miles off Mexico's Pacific coast, nearly 80 years ago with a snake preserved in a jar, but his sample had long been considered a labeling error and his find was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The National Museum of Natural History praised the team's work, describing the snake as the \"only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" The rediscovery \"is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,\" the museum said in a statement."], "all_classes": null, "length": 999}

An investigation into how the tomb came to be destroyed is underway, but it appears to be an open and shut case: Officials simply weren't aware the site existed.

{"pred": " In this one-page summary, I have included the main points from each passage. I have tried to keep the language as neutral as possible and have not included any opinions or analysis. Passage 1: President Obama has ordered his senior national security and intelligence officials to draw up a list of potential overseas targets for US cyber-attacks, a top secret presidential directive obtained by the Guardian reveals. The 18-page Presidential Policy Directive 20, issued in October last year but never published, states that what it calls Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO) \"can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance US national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging\". It says the government will \"identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power\". The directive also contemplates the possible use of cyber actions inside the US, though it specifies that no such domestic operations can be conducted without the prior order of the president, except in cases of emergency. The aim of the document was \"to put in place tools and a framework to enable government to make decisions\" on cyber actions, a senior administration official told the Guardian. The administration published some declassified talking points from the directive in January 2013, but those did not mention the stepping up of America's offensive capability and the drawing up of a target list. Obama's move to establish a potentially aggressive cyber warfare doctrine will heighten fears over the increasing militarization of the internet. The directive's publication comes as the president plans to confront his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a summit in California on Friday over alleged Chinese attacks on western targets. Even before the publication of the directive, Beijing had hit back against US criticism, with a senior official claiming to have \"mountains of data\" on American cyber-attacks he claimed were every bit as serious as those China was accused of having carried out against the US. Passage 2: The Obama administration is refining its use of offensive cyber operations to counter evolving threats of electronic assaults against the United States. Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Friday a directive signed by President Barack Obama last year calls for government cyber tools to be \"integrated with the full array of national security tools we have at our disposal.\" Hayden was responding a report in the British newspaper The Guardian that says Obama has ordered national security and intelligence officials to draw up a list of potential cyber targets overseas. The Guardian report comes as Obama was about to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with alleged Chinese hacking against the U.S. to be one of the main topics of discussion. While the newspaper report offers details about Obama's directive that had not been made public before, the White House released a declassified summary of the directive in January. Moreover, the Pentagon acknowledged in March that it was setting up a series of cyber teams charged with carrying out offensive operations to combat the threat of an electronic assault on the United States. Gen. Keith Alexander, the top officer at U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, testified March 12 before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the potential for an attack against the nation's electric grid and other essential systems is real and that the federal government needed to take more aggressive steps. At the time, Alexander said 13 cyber teams were being formed to guard the nation against destructive attacks in cyberspace, stressing that their role would be offensive. He also said the teams would work outside the United States, but he did not say where. \"This directive will establish principles and processes that can enable more effective planning, development and use of our capabilities,\" Hayden said in a statement Friday. \"It enables us to be flexible, while also exercising restraint in dealing with the threats we face. It continues to be our policy that we shall undertake the least action necessary to mitigate threats and that we will prioritize network defense and law enforcement as the preferred courses of action.\" The timing of Friday's report coincides with Obama's two days of meetings with Xi at a California retreat. Top issues are cybersecurity and North Korea's nuclear threats. Passage 3: President Obama wants to strike up a friendly tone with Chinese President Xi Jinping when they meet today in California but the issues on the table are anything but informal. President Barack Obama and China's new leader, Xi Jinping, made broad commitments Friday to work together on cybersecurity and to improve military-to-military relations as the two leaders wound up a first round of talks during an informal summit at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, California. But both leaders said they'd not yet had detailed talks on cybersecurity—one of the most contentious bilateral issues—and Mr. Obama said they would have \"more extensive discussions\" during a private dinner Friday night. They were due to hold more talks in the morning, before winding up the summit around midday Saturday. For Mr. Obama, who met Mr. Xi for the first time last year when he visited the U.S. as vice president, the summit was an opportunity to get to know the man who will lead China over the next decade. But the Obama administration also had a long list of economic and security concerns, many of which it has confronted China with for years, with mixed results. They include Chinese cyberespionage, North Korea's nuclear program, Beijing's maritime disputes in Asia and Chinese market reforms. Mr. Xi, too, had much at stake, bringing with him a proposal to redefine the relationship with the U.S. as one of equal \"great powers,\"–a personal initiative that is part of his broader campaign to promote a \"Chinese dream\" of a strong nation reclaiming the position in the world that it held until the Opium Wars of the 19th Century. Before the first round of talks, the two leaders—both wearing white dress shirts with open collars and no ties—walked together on the grounds of the estate in the 115-degree heat, and shook hands in front of the cameras. They each made brief statements calling for a new era of bilateral relations, although Mr. Obama stopped short of echoing Mr. Xi's \"great power\" formula. The news conference was dominated by cybersecurity, talks on which could be complicated by the recent disclosures on electronic surveillance by Mr. Obama's own government. \"What both President Xi and I recognize is that because of these incredible advances in technology, that the issue of cybersecurity and the need for rules and common approaches to cybersecurity are going to be increasingly important as part of bilateral relationships and multilateral relationships,\" Mr. Obama said. \"In some ways these are uncharted waters and you don't have the kinds of protocols that cover military issues for example and arms issues where nations have a lot of experiencing in trying to negotiate what's acceptable and what's not.\" Mr. Xi remarked that in the days before the summit, he had noticed a sharp increase in media coverage of cybersecurity issues. \"This might give people the sense or feeling that cybersecurity as a threat mainly comes from China or that the issue cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the U. S-China relationship,\" he said. \"The application of new technology is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it will drive progress…. on the other hand it might create some problems for regulators and it might infringe upon the rights of states, enterprises, societies and individuals.\" Mr. Xi also said the two sides should improve military to military relations, as well as cooperation on trade and the environment. He said he looked forward to maintaining close communication with President Obama, who he invited to visit China for a similar summit \"at an appropriate time\". Mr. Obama said the two sides would \"institutionalize and regularize\" military-to-military talks that have often been suspended in the past, and which aren't yet formally part of a regular U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the latest round of which takes place next month. Mr. Xi didn't appear to be using notes during either the news conference or his earlier statement with Mr. Obama—demonstrating a confidence in his own abilities and in his standing within the Communist Party that his predecessor, Hu Jintao, never displayed during his 10 years in office. U.S. officials said Mr. Xi pushed for the summit and agreed to the informal format despite Chinese leaders' usual preference for highly scripted talking points approved in advance by China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee. Mr. Xi himself drew parallels with the 1972 meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and President Richard Nixon in Beijing, which laid the ground for the normalization of relations six years later. Comparisons have also been made with a visit to the U.S. by Deng Xiaoping in 1979, signaling a return to personal diplomacy in the bilateral relationship. But with expectations in China running so high, analysts say that if Mr. Xi fails to demonstrate a rapport with Mr. Obama—and entice the U.S. to reciprocate his overtures—he could face criticism at home for spurning a Chinese trend of consensus-based decision-making in favor of concentrating more power in his own hands. Chinese media are already portraying the Sunnylands summit as a historic victory for Mr. Xi's \"new-type great power\" initiative—a formula designed to prevent the military conflict that has often arisen between a rising power and an established one. \"China and the United States must find a new path, one that is different from the inevitable confrontation and conflict between the major countries of the past,\" Mr. Xi said. \"And that is to say the two sides must work together to build a new model of major country relationship.\" Mr. Xi sought to allay U.S. concerns that his talk of national rejuvenation implied that China seeks to displace the U.S. as the dominant military power in Asia. \"I stated very clearly to President Obama that China will be firmly committed to the path of peaceful development,\" he said. \"By the Chinese dream we seek to have economic prosperity, national renewal and people's well-being.…It is connected to the American dream and the beautiful dreams people in other countries may have.\" Mr. Obama responded by saying he welcomed China's continued \"peaceful rise\"—echoing a term coined by Mr. Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, that has been used less frequently by Chinese officials since Mr. Xi took power. Mr. Obama endorsed the goal of seeking ways to avoid conflict, but stopped short of echoing Mr. Xi's \"great power\" formulation, saying instead that he hoped for \"more extended\" and informal talks leading to a \"new model of cooperation.\" \"We've got a lot of work to do to take these broad understandings down to the level of specifics and that will require further discussions not only today and tomorrow but for weeks, months, to come,\" he said. \"But what I'm very encouraged about is that both President Xi and myself recognize that we have a unique opportunity to take the US-China relationship to a new level and I am absolutely committed that we don't miss that opportunity.\" Passage 4: President Obama begins to realize the couple’s dream by welcoming President Xi Jinping of China at Sunnylands on Friday. By its unusual informality, the presidents’ two-day meeting is already being interpreted as a milestone in their nations’ often tense and generally stilted four-decade diplomatic history.

The leaders will have six hours of talks, a private dinner, and walks around the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage to try to achieve it.

{"pred": " In the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 randomized trial, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) did not significantly affect overall or disease-free survival of patients with clinical T1-T2 breast cancer and a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) who were treated with lumpectomy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and tangential-field whole-breast radiation therapy. These survival findings are consistent with those of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B04 trial, in which women with clinically negative nodes were randomized to treatment by radical mastectomy, total mastectomy plus nodal irradiation, or total mastectomy with delayed ALND if nodal recurrence was observed. Initially and at each interim analysis for up to 25 years of follow-up, no statistically significant survival differences were observed between any of the groups. For patients treated in the modern era, the relevance of the B04 study, which included patients with larger tumors undergoing mastectomy without adjuvant systemic therapy, is uncertain, because an axillary recurrence after SLND in patients with a lower risk of death from distant disease might negatively affect survival. The findings from Z0011 document the high rate of locoregional control achieved with modern multimodality therapy, even without ALND. In contrast to B04, in which about 40% of patients in the radical mastectomy group were node-positive and the same number in the total mastectomy group were assumed to be node-positive and 5-year overall survival was only about 60%, 100% of patients in Z0011 had nodal involvement; yet the 5-year overall survival was more than 90%. Furthermore, a 19% rate of axillary first failure was observed in B04, whereas the axillary nodal recurrence rate was only 0.9% in the SLND-alone group in Z0011. The excellent local and distant outcomes in this study highlight the effects of multiple changes in breast cancer management during the interval between the 2 studies. These changes, which include improved imaging, more detailed pathological evaluation, improved planning of surgical and radiation approaches, and more effective systemic therapy, emphasize the need for ongoing reevaluation of “standard” local therapy.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

{"pred": " House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) announced he will be stepping down from House leadership at the end of July, after losing his primary to tea party challenger David Brat. Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.) will step down from his leadership post at the end of July, ending a swift rise through the ranks of national politics and upending a leadership team that has run the House since Republicans took control after the 2010 tea party wave election. Less than 24 hours after losing a primary contest to a tea party-backed economist, Cantor announced Wednesday afternoon that he will resign as leader July 31, but keep his seat until his term ends in January. He said that House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) would make an “outstanding” successor. House Republicans plan to hold new leadership elections next Thursday, according to senior aides. In addition to McCarthy, several senior Republicans are mulling bids for top posts, so it wasn’t immediately clear which positions will be open next week. Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) led a Wednesday afternoon meeting of the House Republican conference and thanked Cantor and his staff for their service. “This is a speech I never expected to give,” Boehner said. He was in tears later as Cantor addressed his 232 Republican colleagues. Cantor’s decision to leave his leadership post after losing Tuesday to economist Dave Brat came on a day that Republicans began scrambling to build support and fill the leadership vacuum. McCarthy, the next in line after Boehner and Cantor, is preparing to run for majority leader, but will have competition from more conservative colleagues. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, began texting colleagues Tuesday night asking to speak with them about his bid for majority leader. His top advisers were actively positioning him for the race. A confident Sessions predicted in an interview that he would beat McCarthy, arguing that his work to elect Republicans during the 2010 elections and his current leadership of powerful Rules Committee makes him ready to manage the House floor. “I’ll be a majority leader who will be clear-headed about what we’re going to try to accomplish, putting more focus on what we’re trying to sell,” Sessions said, adding that he has a “strong and open” relationship with Boehner. “I know how to win.” The large Texas Republican delegation, which represents 10 percent of the entire House Republican Conference, planned to meet later Wednesday with the possibility of producing a unified front for Sessions or Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, to be the Lone Star State’s favorite GOP son for a leadership slot. It’s unclear when elections would be held to succeed Cantor, something that will be out of his control. Republicans aligned with more establishment figures privately expressed interest in shortening the race, for fear that a seven-week race until the end of July would be an ideological battlefield that tears the caucus apart. Next week’s planned leadership elections will allow a transition period for Cantor and his staff to leave his post. Allies of the majority leader described the timing of July 31 as one based largely on helping his staff make their moves. In addition to stepping down as majority leader, Cantor told colleagues Wednesday that he will not run as a write-in candidate in November. Cantor returned to the Capitol Wednesday morning by sneaking into the building through a back door on the Senate side in hopes of avoiding reporters. He appeared stone-faced and tense, grimacing when asked by The Washington Post whether he would step down from his leadership post or resign from Congress. Cantor, who has represented the Richmond suburbs since 2001, lost by 11 percentage points to Brat. The 51-year old had been considered the next generation’s GOP leader, who would take over for Boehner, 64,when he retired. In a caucus deeply divided between establishment Republicans and fire-breathing conservatives, these were the two who had shown some ability to keep order. McCarthy hesitated even behind closed doors Wednesday morning to say he would run for majority leader, still stunned by the loss of his close friend, Cantor, according to aides not authorized to speak publicly about the unfolding leadership race. McCarthy spent the morning in his spacious suite on the first floor of the Capitol, reaching out by telephone to more than 100 members, declining to go into details about his plans while hinting, with his appreciation for the encouragement, that he would run for majority leader. Later, he was seen huddling with several colleagues, including Reps. Christopher Smith (R-N.J.), Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Dennis A. Ross (R-Fla.), as he tries to shore up support and avoid competition. A race between McCarthy and Sessions would revive a long-simmering rivalry. They both ran for whip in 2010, with McCarthy besting his older opponent. Ever since, Sessions, 59, has been eager to challenge McCarthy and is telling colleagues that an older, more conservative hand is needed near the top, aides said. With McCarthy seeking to climb the leadership ranks, Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the chief deputy whip, announced to his inner circle Wednesday that he will run for whip, the third-highest position in leadership, and throw his support behind McCarthy as majority leader. Roskam told The Washington Post that he would not comment out of respect to Cantor. He was seen heading to a meeting with his allies to discuss his path ahead. But Roskam is expected to face competition from Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who leads the conservative Republican Study Committee and is already privately whipping votes, and possibly Hensarling, according to aides familiar the jockeying. In his conversations with colleagues, Scalise is making the case that he would serve as “a red state voice” in leadership ranks currently lacking a hardline conservative. Hensarling was seen huddling on the House floor Wednesday afternoon alongside House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), a key conservative broker. Earlier, he had huddled with Reps. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), a trio of renegade Republicans who rarely back leadership. Amid all the activity, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), currently the fourth-ranking Republican as chairman of the House Republican Conference, said Wednesday that she wouldn’t be seeking a higher position, meaning the leadership contest will focus on the majority leader and whip jobs. Boehner, meanwhile, appeared unfazed by the developments. He chatted Wednesday on the floor with close friends and avoided areas of the floor where McCarthy and others were chatting with colleagues. On Tuesday night, he stuck to his usual routine by hanging out with close friends and aides at an Italian restaurant that he likes near Capitol Hill. The fast-paced developments left rank-and-file members stunned as the 233-member caucus began splintering off behind favored candidates. Several conservatives said they were eager to see Cantor replaced by a southern conservative. “I just think that there is a geographical area of the country that has not been represented in leadership and I think that could be the determining factor in what happens,” said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, (R-Ga.). Asked to further clarify which area of the country he thought the next majority leader should hail from, Westmoreland replied: “Get a map.” But Rep. Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican close to Boehner, pushed back on suggestions that the next leader needs to be from the south. “Where does it say that in the constitution?” he quipped to reporters. Tiberi cautioned that the tea party success in ousting Cantor doesn’t necessarily signal an oncoming insurgence of conservatives into the GOP House leadership. “I’ve been around this business for 14 years and I can’t remember when there hasn’t been an anti-Washington feeling,” he said. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) suggested that the GOP leadership team should have more equal political representation. “We need to have some people on there from red states as opposed to having all of them from blue states,” he told reporters. Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a frequent critic of Boehner and Cantor, said he hopes to elect a leader with deeper roots in the conservative base of the party. “There’s a widespread concern about the Republican establishment not listening to conservatives and so I think it had energized the tea party,” he said. “It’s certainly not dead as we found out last night.” Other colleagues, still shellshocked by Tuesday’s stunning turn of events, just expressed condolences. “I’m sorry my friend lost,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). Brat, meanwhile, appeared to struggle under fresh scrutiny of his upstart campaign. His campaign abruptly cancelled a scheduled news conference. “Sorry, we’re kind of flying by the seat-of-our pants today,” a staffer said, explaining that the campaign decided to develop a media strategy before talking again to the press. That decision came after Brat appeared on MSNBC to suggest that Cantor had lost touch with his district. Cantor “has not been present in the district,” he said. “I was door-knocking, I know what was on the minds of the folks,” he added later. But Brat appeared caught off guard by a barrage of policy questions. “I thought we were just going to chat today about the celebratory aspect,” he said.

Marco Rubio, R-Florida, then a presidential candidate himself, the same moniker. \"I'm the writer,\" Trump told New York magazine in 2016. \"Let me start with Little Marco. He just looked like Little Marco to me. And it's not Little. It's Liddle. L-I-D-D-L-E. And it's not L-Y-I-N apostrophe. Ted's a liar, so that was easy.\" The feud between Corker and Trump had escalated this weekend when the President tweeted that the outgoing senator \"begged\" for his endorsement before declining to run for re-election. \"He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said 'NO THANKS.' He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal,\" Trump tweeted. \"Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!\" Todd Womack, Corker's chief of staff, denied the claim later in the day. \"The President called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,\" Womack said in a statement. Corker, in the New York Times interview, said that Trump is acting \"like he's doing 'The Apprentice' or something,\" and added that he could set the nation \"on the path to World War III.\" The comment comes a week after Corker jabbed Trump, stating that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \"help separate our country from chaos.\" The clash between Corker and Trump highlights fraying relations between the President and the men and women in Congress who the White House needs to deliver on the agenda Trump ran on.

Now what? James Fallows at the Atlantic writes that if Corker truly believes Trump might blunder his way into World War III, he has an obligation to \"do something about it\" by providing a crucial check on Trump's actions through his position as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. \"Talk is better than nothing, but action is what counts.\" WSJ weighs in: The conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal thinks Corker spoke the truth about the president's \"lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O'Donnell,\" and it hopes other top Republicans follow Corker's lead because it might actually help. Little reaction: NBC News rounds up reaction from top Republicans to Corker's statements about the president and finds \"silence or a shrug.\" A typical sentiment, from Marco Rubio: \"You'll have to ask Sen.

This was the worst climbing accident in the history of Everest. The Sherpas are demanding better compensation and safety measures from the Nepali government and the guiding companies. The commercial guiding operation on Everest, Himalayan Experience (Himex), has also been struggling with the instability of the high-alpine environment. The owner of Himex, Russell Brice, decided to cancel his climb and go home due to dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures, dire warnings from experienced sherpas, a massive serac threatening climbers, abundant rockfall, and at least two near misses from avalanches.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The spacecraft has spent more than nine years on its 4.8 billion kilometer journey to Pluto, the last world in the solar system to be visited by a spacecraft. The spacecraft will take scores of photographs as it speeds past Pluto and its five known moons, Charon, Hydra, Nix, STyx, and Kerberos.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time.

{"pred": " Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. The co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, is believed to have locked the captain out of the cockpit and then deliberately crashed the plane. The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording. France's accident investigation agency, BEA, is \"dismayed\" by the voice recording leak to Bild. The flight took off 20 minutes late. After reaching cruising altitude, the captain asked the co-pilot to prepare the landing. Once that's finished, the co-pilot again tells the captain he \"can go anytime.\" There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, \"You can take over.\" At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend. Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the \"sink rate,\" Bild reported. Next comes the banging. The captain says, \"You can take over.\" At 10:38, and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. Screams can be heard one final time. Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. Quest called it \"unbelievable\" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, said on Saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point. But French authorities have said that Lubitz appeared to have crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately into the Alps on Tuesday as it flew from Barcelona, Spain, toward Dusseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind since then, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. Anxiety, burnout and depression A handful of publications, citing unnamed sources, have reported that Lubitz suffered from various psychological maladies. CNN has not been able to confirm these reports. Lubitz suffered from \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" and from severe depression in the past, Le Parisien newspaper reported Sunday, citing sources close to the investigation. In 2010, Lubitz received injections of antipsychotic medication, the paper said. He was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters, but it's unclear when that happened, according to Le Parisien. The newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes, which forbade him from working from March 16 to March 29. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A subsequent report from the Times on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. However, an official with Lufthansa, said that if Lubitz had vision problems, they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination. Citing an unidentified senior investigator, German newspaper Die Welt said that Lubitz suffered from a severe \"psychosomatic illness\" and that German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a \"severe subjective burnout syndrome\" and from severe depression, the source told the newspaper. News reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. Investigators are expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside. Lubitz had a girlfriend, a teacher at a school in Dusseldorf not far from his apartment, according to German media. 'This is a man whose life is totally broken' Dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony Saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains, France. Most of the people on the plane were from Germany and Spain. Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. The mayor of one local community said he had seen Lubitz's father on Thursday evening, describing him as \"a man in deep distress.\" \"We get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders,\" Bernard Bartolini, the mayor of Prads-Haute-Bleone, said Saturday. \"I can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken,\" Bartolini said. \"He had so much emotion in him.\" ", "answers": ["Investigators carrying out the grim task of recovering wreckage and human remains from the Germanwings crash say they have not found an intact body—or the flight data recorder.

Investigators say that so far, only the empty protective casing of the black box has been found. In other developments: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman Tom Enders slammed TV coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, Deutsche Welle reports. \"Sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact,\" he said, calling some of the reporting \"outrageous nonsense\" that was a \"mockery of the victims.\" The cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and German newspaper Bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer (also spelled Sonderheimer or Sondheimer, depending on the source) can be heard pleading for Lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \"Open the goddamn door!\" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for France's accident investigation agency tells CNN that investigators are \"dismayed\" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that Lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including Bild, also reported that Lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the Independent. In Lubitz's hometown of Montabaur, the local Lutheran pastor tells the AP that despite mounting evidence that Lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family.

{"pred": " Donald Trump has alarmed and perplexed some experts and others in Washington when he pronounced, without offering more details, via Twitter on Thursday that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” He further escalated his call on Friday, telling the MSNBC program “Morning Joe” that he is fine with the country taking part in an “arms race” if it puts the U.S. in a stronger position against foreign adversaries. After the remark was reported on MSNBC, though, incoming Trump press secretary Sean Spicer pushed back and insisted that the remarks came from a “private conversation” with “Morning Joe” host Mika Brzezinski. While he told the “Today” Show’s Matt Lauer that “there is not going to be” an arms race, he told CNN that Trump is not going to “take anything off the table,” either. It remains unclear where the president-elect stands, but given longstanding bipartisan support for preventing nuclear escalation, if followed through Trump’s statements would represent an extraordinary shift in how the U.S. approaches the role of weapons of mass destruction in its own defenses and throughout the world. President Barack Obama has advanced a vision of “America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.” At first, after his Thursday tweet, Trump’s own supporters had tried to downplay what it meant. It was unclear, for example, whether Trump was advocating the U.S. increasing the size of its nuclear arsenal, which would be a major change, or if he was speaking of modernizing it. Such a suggestion would be in line with ongoing efforts and not necessarily controversial. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s former campaign manager who was recently named incoming counselor to the president, told an irate Rachel Maddow on Thursday night that Trump may have meant the latter. Regardless, Conway insisted during the heated exchange on MSNBC, the tweet did not necessarily represent a policy change, but Trump “talking about keeping us safe and secure.” “There are a lot of people hiding under the bed right now because it doesn’t seem like he knows what he’s talking about on this issue,” Maddow said. “That’s not fair,” Conway responded, later adding, “He’s not making policy on Twitter. … Again, perhaps he is also echoing what President Obama himself has tried to do here, which is get upgrades to our nuclear systems.” Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, had also said on Thursday that the president-elect was talking about expanding nonproliferation efforts, not stoking an arms race. “President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it — particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes,” Miller said in a statement. “He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.” Trump’s comments Friday, of course, seemed to directly contradict that. The controversy started after Russian President Vladimir Putin called on his country to “strengthen” its nuclear forces. “We need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defense systems,” he said earlier this week, according to multiple news reports. But Putin at an annual news conference on Friday said Russia has no interest in a nuclear arms race and seemed to normalize Trump’s statements, calling his tweet unsurprising. “Of course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case,” Putin said, adding, “As for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his elections campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general.” During the election season, Trump made contradictory statements about nuclear proliferation. He suggested that some countries — including Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia — should be allowed to develop them, despite efforts to prevent more countries from doing so. But he also told The New York Times in March that “it’s a very scary nuclear world.” “Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation,” Trump said at the time. Trump’s more recent comments about expanding America’s nuclear capability go against decades of policy to reduce the stockpile of nuclear warheads and could potentially violate an arms control treaty with Russia. The U.S. has a stockpile of roughly 4,500 nuclear warheads and nearly 1,500 deployed warheads (Russia’s armaments are nearly identical, as both nations account for more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads). The U.S. and Russia are due to meet nuclear reduction targets by February 2018 under the New START Treaty, which can be extended for another five years in 2021. Experts remain confused and in some cases unnerved by the nature of Trump’s foray into the nuclear weapons discussion. On Thursday, John Tierney, a former Democratic congressman and current executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, presented Trump’s tweet as perilous. “It is dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet,” he said in a statement, warning that an expansion threatens a nuclear arms race. “The potential consequences of changing U.S. nuclear weapons policy so drastically are simply unimaginable,” he warned. “Current plans already call for spending $1 trillion over the next three decades to modernize and maintain the U.S. nuclear arsenal, which the Pentagon has expressed concern about being able to afford. The President-elect will have to explain why any increase is necessary both financially and strategically.” Joseph Cirincione, the president of the global security foundation Ploughshares Fund and a nuclear weapons expert, called Trump's actions “bizarre, unprecedented and completely out of bounds behavior for a president-elect.” Incoming presidents usually wait until they take office to make pronouncements on a topic like nuclear policy, Cirincione said. Beyond that, he said he is alarmed by the cavalier attitude Trump seems to have toward as enormously sensitive an issue as weapons of mass destruction. While Trump might see Twitter as a means to convey strength to his constituents at home, Cirincione said, “the rest of the world is watching,” and other countries could respond with actions of their own. “You can’t use Twitter to make nuclear policy,” Cirincione said. “Look, you should at least wait until you’re president. But this is why — this kind of view that he’s breaking with convention, he wants to shake things up, I understand that, but not on nuclear policy. There are reasons why people spend days crafting the language of nuclear policy.” “These things can be very complicated,” he continued, “and every word matters.” ", "answers": ["Donald Trump woke everyone from their pre-Christmas slumber Thursday with a tweet calling for a strengthened and expanded US nuclear arsenal.

A team of astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance between 19 galaxies with unprecedented accuracy, and found that the universe is expanding between 5 and 9 percent faster than the rate derived from galactic distances measured in the early universe. The most recent calculation of the universe's rate of expansion, called the Hubble constant, is believed to be the most accurate ever, with a margin of error of just 2.4 percent. Researchers believe the discrepancy may offer insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which make up 95 percent of the universe and do not emit light. The new numbers are based upon the team's efforts to acquire a more precise understanding of the universe's current expansion rate. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck I telescope, they refined that to an uncertainty of only 2.4 percent. The new data were gleaned by analyzing two types of star: Cepheids and Type la supernovae. Cepheid stars allow astronomers to determine how far they are from us, and thereby how distant their galaxy is, by analyzing two characteristics: their true brightness, gleaned from the rate at which they pulsate, versus their apparent brightness as seen from Earth. Type la supernovae, a kind of exploding star, can be detected even further away. The researchers measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars occupying 19 nearby galaxies, compared the apparent brightness of both types of star, and were able to determine the true brightness of the Type la supernovae. Armed with this information, they could calculate the distance to some 300 Type la supernovae in distant galaxies.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years.

{"pred": " President Donald Trump is set to embark on his first foreign trip as President of the United States, a nine-day, five-city excursion across the Middle East and Europe. The trip comes at a critical moment for Trump's young presidency, as he faces a series of controversies at home, including the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the appointment of a special counsel to probe his campaign's ties with Russia. Despite the domestic turmoil, the White House once hoped the trip could offer a chance at a reset after a tumultuous first four months in office. Trump's advisers saw it as an opportunity for the United States to boldly reassert itself on the world stage and resume a leadership role that the administration believes was abdicated by President Barack Obama. Trump's powerful senior adviser, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, led a West Wing team to craft the agenda, laden with religious symbolism. The itinerary, which begins Saturday in Saudi Arabia, is a startlingly ambitious excursion for a president who dislikes travel and has displayed a shaky grasp of foreign affairs. Each stop comes with high stakes. In Saudi Arabia, the president will deliver a speech to the Islamic world meant to be a clear contrast with the vision Obama laid out in his first trip to the region. In Israel, Trump will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, looking to smooth over fresh tensions. Israel was in an uproar earlier this week after U.S. officials confirmed Trump shared highly classified intelligence about the Islamic State group with senior Russian officials visiting the White House. The information, about an IS threat related to the use of laptops on aircraft, came from Israel and there were concerns a valuable Israeli asset could be in danger. In Rome, the president will call upon Pope Francis, the popular, liberal-minded pontiff. Trump denounced Francis during the campaign, calling the holiest man in the Catholic faith \"disgraceful\" for questioning his faith. In Brussels, Trump will attend a meeting of NATO, the World War II-era alliance which Trump has repeatedly mused about abandoning because member states weren't paying their fair share. He recently has shifted to reassure wary allies that he remains committed to the pact. And in Sicily, the president will meet with the other leaders of the G7, a gathering of Western economic powers. Key parts of the group are unsettled by Trump's unpredictability and his willingness to cheer on nationalist sentiment. Trump's itinerary is heavy with religious symbolism. He'll visit the birthplace of Islam, the Jewish homeland and the Vatican. Officials say the message is \"unity.\" \"He strongly believes that it is the strength of the faith of people in these religions that will stand up and ultimately be victorious over these forces of terrorism,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. Administration officials believe the unexpected move of going to Saudi Arabia first was meant to underscore the seriousness of the United States' commitment to fighting extremist groups like the Islamic State. Trump, whose denunciations of Iran have been welcomed by the Saudis, wants to frame the conflict not as one between the West and Islam, but simply between good and evil, according to his aides. While some Middle East leaders will likely greet Trump warmly, he could receive a far cooler reception in Europe. Though Pope Francis has said he'd \"never make a judgment about a person without hearing him out,\" others on the continent have sharply criticized Trump. That includes France's newly elected President Emmanuel Macron, who denounced Trump's musings on abandoning the Paris climate treaty, a likely point of contention in Sicily. Trump's inauguration sparked thousands of protesters to fill the streets of several European capitals, chaotic scenes that could be repeated during his stops in Rome, Brussels and Sicily. \"Welcome to the White House abroad,\" said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's former press secretary. \"This is a great opportunity for the president to change the subject, to make real news. But the downside is that it could be dominated by domestic-style questions. ... Every first trip is over-scrutinized.

A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the Jerusalem Post that Trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion. The president's European stops will include meetings with Pope Francis and dozens of other leaders and heads of state, Time reports in a detailed look at his itinerary. Among them will be new French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump for a working lunch May 25. Sources tell the New York Times that Trump has complained to friends that he doesn't really want to go on the trip. His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen J. Hadley, George W. Bush's national security adviser, however, says such trips are tightly controlled and Trump will probably be at ease on the world stage. \"Remember, Trump is a nothing if not a showman,\" Hadley says. “He’s been very public for decades and very conscious about how he comes across in the media.\" Heritage Foundation foreign policy expert James Carofano tells the Washington Post that the trip abroad will be an opportunity for Trump to have a fresh start after his troubles in DC. \"The great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda and you control the press access,\" he says. \"If you fumble on one of these trips, it’s nobody’s fault but your own.\" Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, disagrees. He tells the AP no other president has made a first foreign trip amid so much controversy. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world. And while the pictures from the trip may be great, the White House can't change the headlines that will follow him wherever he goes,\" he says. Melania Trump will be accompanying her husband on the trip, and her itinerary includes G7 and NATO spousal programs as well as speaking to American military families in Italy, Politico reports. \"This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries,\" she said in a statement Thursday.

{"pred": " Henry Rayhons, a former Iowa state legislator, is awaiting trial on a felony charge that he raped his wife, Donna Young, at a nursing home where she was living. The Iowa Attorney General's office says Rayhons had intercourse with his wife when she lacked the mental capacity to consent because she had Alzheimer's. She died on August 8, four days short of her 79th birthday, of complications from the disease. One week later, Rayhons, 78, was arrested. He pleaded not guilty. Based on evidence generated so far, state prosecutors are likely to portray Rayhons as a sex-hungry man who took advantage of a sweet, confused woman who didn't know what month it was, forgot how to eat a hamburger and lost track of her room. The question of how to deal with sex by those who aren't mentally competent is quite complex; it also arises, of course, with regard to those who are mentally disabled all their lives. But I think, in cases like the Rayhons case, the key is to consider the nature of the parties' past relationship, something Iowa law does to some extent but not enough. It's shocking to me that, until several decades ago, a husband's forcing his wife to have sex wasn't generally considered rape in the United States. It seems to me quite obvious that spouses are entitled to say \"no.\" At the same time, it seems to me equally obvious that we must consider the parties' past and unrevoked consent as relevant in some situations where there's neither a \"no\" or a \"yes.\" If A starts caressing B's genitals while B is sleeping, that's generally a serious crime. But if A and B are sexually involved, it seems to me it shouldn't be a crime at all — especially if this has happened before and both parties were quite happy about it — unless B wakes up and says no, or has indicated lack of consent to such behavior in the past. This is just a reflection of the fact that \"consent,\" like much in life, can be implied and long-lasting and not just express and short-term. If we're good friends and you keep letting me borrow something, that may be evidence of consent to borrow it even when I'm not around to expressly say, \"yes, you can borrow it again.\" That immediate consent is impossible, because you're absent, doesn't mean that there is no consent. Sex is not identical, of course, to borrowing gardening equipment, but in this respect it strikes me as similar: Even when someone isn't able to immediately consent, it's sometimes (though not always) reasonable to determine whether they would have consented by looking to past practice among the parties. And this is especially so, I think, when the incapacity is permanent or at least long-lasting. I don't think the law should require lovers or spouses to wake each other up before touching each other's genitals, even when past practice suggests this is consensual. But at least such a requirement would only slightly interfere with people's lives. If the law criminalizes sex among lovers altogether once one of them has become mentally incapacitated, however warm their relationship was beforehand, that's a lifetime constraint. And it's not just a constraint once the incapacitation sets in. It's a burden even on people who are not yet incapacitated but who know they are getting there, and who are upset that for many years to come they would be unable to give this sort of pleasure to their life partners — or to get this pleasure from them. If you were facing such a mental decline, would you want to know that the law will \"protect\" you from your beloved husband or wife this way? Interestingly, Iowa law takes this into account in some measure, treating spouses differently from others, though not enough for Mr. Rayhons (or for the hypothetical sleeping couple), and not in a way that covers long-term lovers who aren't married. Rayhons is charged with third-degree sexual abuse. ", "answers": ["An Iowa state lawmaker says he loved visiting his wife at a nursing home before her death at age 79.

The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person. The Bachelor started filming in September, and it's unclear if Martinez was still filming when she was reported missing. She tweets \"the scariest thing\" about being a missing person \"is that my efforts to conceal The Worst Drivers License Photo Of All Time have been thwarted\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4630}
{"pred": " MIT is hosting a \"Make the Breast Pump Not Suck\" hackathon to improve the design and technology behind breast pumps and make the act of pumping less awkward. The event brings together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm new innovations. The current problems with the breast pump include the motor being loud, too many parts, difficulty in cleaning, inability to lay down and pump, lack of good space to pump, difficulty in keeping track of what is pumped, and the perception of pumping as weird by colleagues. The hackathon aims to address these issues and seed ideas, connections, and projects that will make the breast pump experience better. ", "answers": ["It might not be the first thing that comes to mind after the word \"hackathon,\" but organizers of an upcoming one at MIT say the world is long overdue for a better breast pump. Engineers, designers, moms, and health experts will gather later this month for reasons spelled out by organizers at their website: \"The motor is loud. There are too many parts. They are hard to clean. You can’t lay down and pump. There is no good space to pump. It’s hard to keep track of what you pump. Your colleagues think pumping is weird. People are skeeved out by breastmilk. People are embarrassed by breasts.\" The Sept. 20-21 hackathon is an offshoot of a smaller brainstorming session in May that was in itself prompted by this article in the New York Times lamenting the baffling lack of progress on breast pumps. By and large, they remain complicated and sometimes painful. It's about time, writes Melissa Malamut at Boston Magazine. \"Let’s not forget that you just pushed a baby out of your body. You’d think that would be the hardest part of being a new mom. But no, then you also have to deal with the annoyances of pumping.\" Business Insider calls it \"one of the biggest issues for working mothers,\" and NBC News notes that half of all new mothers breastfeed for six months, meaning that most require pumps for at least parts of that stretch. The public health benefits of breastfeeding are \"huge,\" say organizers, making the current pump designs all the more frustrating. Hackathon participants will split into teams and pitch prototypes at the end of the session. (A new issue: Moms who breastfeed while using medical marijuana.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4643}
{"pred": " Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower, is on the run after revealing the extent of American surveillance programs. After fleeing from Hong Kong, Snowden is expected to fly to Cuba and Venezuela en route to possible asylum in Ecuador. The U.S. has requested Moscow to hand Snowden over to Washington, but Russia has not complied. Snowden's options are limited, and it is unclear if he will continue disclosing classified information. The Chinese government was pleased with Snowden's revelations, but in the long term, China's relationship with the U.S. is more important. Snowden's disclosures have caused a surge of anti-American sentiment in China, and the Chinese government has managed to drain the contents of the four laptops that Snowden brought to Hong Kong. ", "answers": ["Edward Snowden spent the night in Moscow's airport and was expected to fly to Cuba today—but American authorities are making it clear that they'd prefer that the NSA whistleblower was enjoying their hospitality instead. In a statement, the National Security Council said it expects Moscow to look at \"all options available to expel Mr. Snowden back to the US to face justice\" especially in light of \"intensified cooperation after the Boston Marathon bombings and our history of working with Russia on law enforcement matters,\" CBS reports. But \"intensified cooperation\" may not be coming: The Washington Post reports that a Russian official today told Interfax that Moscow doesn't have the legal authority to comply with the US government's request. Other officials add that air travelers who don't cross passport control aren't technically on Russian land; because Snowden is without a Russian visa, there's no way he could have gone through passport control. John Kerry is chiming in, adds the AP, calling it \"deeply troubling\" if Russia allows Snowden to flee. But is Snowden actually Cuba-bound? The airline Aeroflot told the AP he was booked on a Moscow-Havana flight this morning (the expectation being he'd then travel to Venezuela and then to Ecuador, where WikiLeaks says he will seek asylum), prompting a number of journalists to grab seats on said flight. But Snowden apparently never boarded, reports Business Insider via an article with this headline: \"Russia Just Punked a Bunch of Journalists Who Are Now On Their Way to Havana.\" AP Moscow correspondent Max Seddon confirmed that there was no sign of Snowden, tweeting, \"Cuba here we come. Taxiing down Sheremetevo runway and no sign of Snowden. Seats empty still by 17A.\" How did Snowden get out of Hong Kong yesterday to begin with? Despite the Chinese territory's autonomy, the final decision came from Beijing, sources tell the New York Times. The move lets China save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle. Some legal experts are telling the New York Times the US government goofed in waiting until Saturday to revoke Snowden's passport, though charges were filed June 14. Says a former federal prosecutor, \"They missed an opportunity to freeze him in place.\" Still, the Times notes that Snowden may have still been able to fly to Moscow sans passport thanks to special refugee travel documents from Ecuador that WikiLeaks helped Snowden obtain."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4718}

Duncan, who had been in critical condition since being admitted on September 28, was given an experimental antiviral drug and began receiving kidney dialysis when his kidneys failed on October 4. His condition had shown some improvement, with his temperature and blood pressure returning to normal and his diarrhea slowing. However, his liver function had declined and it was uncertain whether this would continue to improve. Duncan's family, who had been quarantined since his hospitalization, visited him at the hospital on October 7 but declined to view him via video as the last time had been too upsetting. The hospital said Duncan was in critical condition and sedated but stable. The family of Duncan, who had come to the United States from Liberia to reunite with his fiancée, Louise Troh, had been in Dallas to support him and to pray for his recovery.

We're monitoring with extreme vigilance.\" Before he became unresponsive, Duncan apologized to his fiancee and told her he would have \"preferred to stay in Liberia and died than bring this to you,\" a family friend tells the Washington Post. The friend says he told her, \"I'm so sorry all of this is happening ...

{"pred": " Innovation in baking and pastry has become a popular trend, with hybridized and fetishized sweets taking on new forms. Maury Rubin's pretzel croissant and Dominique Ansel's Cronut are two examples of this trend, with Rubin's creation being a cross between a croissant and pretzel, and Ansel's creation being a cross between a croissant and doughnut. Rubin, who had a successful career as an Emmy-winning television producer, turned to baking after returning from Parisian training. He opened the original City Bakery in 1990, where he created the pretzel croissant. Rubin believes that the superior-baked-goods business is a brutal one in New York, and the lunch business can be a good one. He has also faced rising costs in the past several years, with the price of oil determining the cost of transportation and food. Ansel, who had a classical French culinary education, opened his own bakery in SoHo, where he introduced the Cronut. He believes that the Cronut became popular because it is a mixture of two separate yet familiar pleasures, newly joined into one good bite. Dunkin' Donuts has also introduced a croissant-doughnut hybrid, called the Croissant Donut, but has asked consumers not to call it a \"Cronut.\" ", "answers": ["Starting next week, you'll be able to nosh on a croissant-donut hybrid if you live near a Dunkin' Donuts—but don't call the delectable dessert a Cronut.

The new offering will have the same glaze as Dunkin's Glazed Donut, won't have filling (for now), and will sell for $2.49—more than twice what the chain's regular donuts go for, making it more profitable for a company that's seen flagging sales, the AP notes. DD won't cop to any Cronut copycat crime, though. \"Are we copying a specific bakery in New York? The answer is no,\" Dunkin's president of global marketing and innovation says.
